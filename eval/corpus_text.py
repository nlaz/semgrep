"""Read a corpus file the way semgrep does.

Ground truth is a line span. A line span only means something if the harness
and the engine agree on what a line is and on which files exist — and they did
not. Two disagreements, both found by the gold-span validator on real corpora:

**1. What counts as a line break.** Python's `str.splitlines()` breaks on
`\\x0b \\x0c \\x1c \\x1d \\x1e \\x85 \\u2028 \\u2029` as well as `\\n`. Rust's
`str::lines()`, which `corpus/chunk.rs:59` uses, breaks on `\\n` alone. So on
any file containing one of those characters the two number the lines
differently from that point on, and a gold span recorded under one convention
addresses different text under the other. Measured share of files where they
disagree:

    jekyll 4.19%   etcd 1.99%   vscode 1.04%   commons-lang 0.84%
    linux  0.27%   tokio 0.00%

Form feeds (`\\x0c`) are the common case — GNU C style uses them as page
separators, which is why the kernel has 232 of them.

**2. Which files exist at all.** `corpus/mod.rs:82` skips any file with a NUL
byte in its first 8192 bytes. A gold span in such a file is unfindable by
construction: every condition misses it, forever, and it reads as a uniform
accuracy loss rather than a bookkeeping error. commons-lang has an OSS-Fuzz
test like this, and two generated queries pointed straight at it.

Both rules are mirrored here rather than approximated. If the engine's rules
change, this module is the one place to change with them.
