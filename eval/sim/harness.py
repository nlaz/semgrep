"""Running semgrep as a *session*, and recording what happened.

`eval/` scores single queries and `bench/` times single queries. Neither can see
behavior that only exists across a sequence: the index is a cache (RESEARCH.md
§8), so write-through, read-repair, the TTL gate, LRU eviction and corrupt-entry
disposal all need step N to change what step N+1 sees.

A **session** is an ordered sequence of steps against one corpus root under one
isolated `SEMGREP_CACHE_DIR`. A **step** is one of:

  mutate   the world changes (edit files, corrupt an artifact, shrink a budget)
  invoke   one semgrep process runs
  check    a pre-registered expectation is evaluated against everything so far

Sessions are written as JSONL: line 0 is a header pinning the scenario, its
expectations, and provenance; the rest are step records. Header-pinned,
flush-per-record, torn-last-line tolerant — the discipline `run_eval.Checkpoint`
established, for the same reason (a run that dies partway should leave readable
evidence, not a file nobody can trust).

Stdlib only, like every other harness here.
