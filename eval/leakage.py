"""How much of the answer does a query already contain?

RESEARCH.md §12.3 established that our self-written query sets sit at two
poles neither of which is where users are: `direct` hands the tool the gold
identifier (66-70% of the time), `paraphrase` deliberately strips it (2%).
§12.5's conclusion was that no quality claim should be read without knowing
which pole produced it. This module makes that operational — `run_eval.py`
prints these numbers above every results table, so a recall figure cannot be
quoted without its leakage beside it.

It also measures a leak §12 did not: **path leakage**. `generate.py` used to
pass the file path into the generator prompt, and semgrep's tokenizer does
path augmentation, so the generator saw the document identifier and the
scorer indexes the document identifier. Measured on the sets on disk before
that prompt was fixed:

    set        kind        basename   stem    dir-segment
    linux      direct          1.5%   32.7%         48.2%
    linux      paraphrase      0.0%    0.0%         25.1%
    vscode     direct          0.0%   22.5%         46.0%
    vscode     paraphrase      0.0%    0.0%         26.5%
    wikipedia  both            0.0%    0.0%          0.0%

The honest caveat, which the headline number must carry: in C a file stem and
an identifier prefix are frequently the same token (`blkg-rwstat.c` <->
`blkg_rwstat_add`), so `stem_in_query` partly re-measures §12.1's identifier
leakage rather than isolating a new one. `path_seg_not_in_gold` is the clean
number — a path segment present in the query but absent from the gold chunk
text cannot be explained away as identifier overlap.
