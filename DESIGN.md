# semgrep — a semantic grep for agents

**Status:** v1 design, 2026-07-27
**Name:** `semgrep` — semantic grep. Chosen for direct lineage with grep/ripgrep,
which is the incumbent agent search tool this project benchmarks against.
(Distinct from r2c Semgrep, the static-analysis tool.)

## Goal

A grep-shaped search tool that agents can drop in wherever they use `grep`/`rg`,
but that also understands *meaning*: ranked lexical search (BM25) and semantic
search (embeddings), fused into one result list. Success is measured two ways:

1. **Quality** — the tool finds the right code/docs for natural-language and
   fuzzy queries where grep finds nothing or noise.
2. **Cost** — latency, peak RSS, and CPU time close enough to ripgrep-class
   tools that adoption isn't blocked. We benchmark all of this against
   `grep`, `ripgrep`, `ugrep`, and `ack`.

## Foundation: the Bog stack

| Crate  | Role here |
| ------ | --------- |
| `ese`  | Static text embeddings (default 512-dim f32), compiled into the binary, CPU-only, very fast (`encode` is rayon-parallel). Makes *unindexed* semantic search feasible. |
| `anny` | HNSW ANN index. `Hnsw<f32, Cosine, 512, …>` with `to_bytes`/`from_bytes` for on-disk persistence. Cosine handles unnormalized vectors (`1 − cos`). |
| `fold` | Incremental dataflow over fjall. **Deferred to v2** (watch mode / incremental reindex). v1 indexes with a lean purpose-built format so the memory story stays clean. |

Both are consumed as path dependencies (`../anny`, `../ese`) for now.

## Search modes

| Mode       | What it is | Unindexed (cold) | Indexed (warm) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| `keyword`  | Regex/literal match, grep semantics | Parallel scan via ripgrep's own crates (`grep-regex`, `grep-searcher`, `ignore`) | Same scan (no keyword index in v1 — rg is already near-optimal here; this keeps our keyword numbers honest) |
| `bm25`     | Ranked lexical search over chunks | One-pass in-memory index build, then query | Serialized postings |
| `semantic` | Embedding similarity over chunks (default mode — semantic-first, RESEARCH.md §14) | Stream files → chunk → `ese::encode` → brute-force top-k (bounded memory: only a k-heap retained) | Default: exact rayon brute-force over the mmap'd embedding matrix (memory-light; ~2 GB of vectors would otherwise sit resident in HNSW for a kernel-sized corpus). `semgrep index --hnsw` opts into the `anny` graph for ~ms queries; benchmarks compare both. |
| `hybrid`   | Reciprocal-rank fusion of `bm25` + `semantic` (off by default until semantic carries its weight, RESEARCH.md §14) | Both cold paths share one corpus pass | Both warm paths |

**Why chunks for both BM25 and semantic:** one document table, one granularity,
so fusion and eval scoring are apples-to-apples, and every result maps back to
`file:line`.

### Chunking

Line-window chunks: `W` lines with `O` lines of overlap (defaults `W=32`,
`O=8`, configurable). Chunk record = `(file_id, start_line, end_line)`.
Chunk text is embedded as-is (ese normalizes/case-folds internally). Files are
skipped if binary (NUL sniff) or > max-file-size (default 4 MiB).

### Tokenizer (BM25)

Code-aware: split on non-alphanumerics, then split `camelCase` /
`PascalCase` / `snake_case` identifiers into subtokens; lowercase; keep both
the whole identifier and its subtokens; drop tokens shorter than 2 chars.
BM25 params: k1 = 1.2, b = 0.75.

### Hybrid fusion

RRF: `score(d) = Σ 1/(60 + rank_i(d))` over the BM25 and semantic lists
(top-128 each), ties broken by semantic score. Cheap, robust, no tuning of
score scales. Exact keyword hits can optionally boost (v1.1).

## Index format (`.semgrep/` at corpus root)

| File | Contents |
| ---- | -------- |
| `meta.json` | Format version (v2), chunk params, dims, `normalized`/`quantized` flags, file table (path, size, mtime) for staleness detection |
| `chunks.bin` | postcard: `Vec<Chunk{file_id, start_line, end_line}>` |
| `bm25.flat` | Flat mmap-able BM25: sorted term table (binary-searched in place) + postings blob + doc lengths. Zero deserialization — provenance showed the old postcard load cost ~840 ms/query on the kernel |
| `emb.bin` | i8-quantized unit-normalized matrix, `n_chunks × 512` bytes, mmap'd. 4× smaller than f32 — the brute scan is page-fault/IO bound, so bytes-on-disk is the latency lever |
| `hnsw.bin` | optional `anny` graph (`index --hnsw`). Skipped at query time when > 1 GiB: one-shot deserialize (~20 s at kernel scale) loses to the quantized brute scan until the graph has a zero-copy format; a persistent server mode would amortize it |

Staleness: on search, compare file table against the live tree; warn (and
optionally `--reindex`) if drift exceeds a threshold. v1 reindex is a full
rebuild; incremental is the fold-based v2.

HNSW compile-time params: `DIM=512, M0=32 (M=16), K=128, EF_SEARCH=192,
EF_BUILD=128, MAX_LEVEL=16`. Runtime `k ≤ 128` served from HNSW; larger k
falls back to exact brute-force over `emb.bin`.

## CLI

```
semgrep <QUERY> [PATH]              # search (default mode: semantic; auto-uses .semgrep/ if present & fresh)
  --mode semantic|keyword|bm25|hybrid
  -k, --top N                   # ranked modes, default 10
  -C, --context N               # context lines around the hit line
  -i, --ignore-case             # keyword mode
  -e, --regex                   # alias for --mode keyword
  --json                        # JSONL: {path, start_line, end_line, line, score, mode, snippet}
  --no-index                    # force unindexed path even if .semgrep/ exists
  --stats                       # print timing/memory footprint to stderr
semgrep index [PATH]                # build/refresh .semgrep/
semgrep index --status              # index freshness report
```

Grep-compatible output for all modes: `path:line:text` (ranked modes print the
best-matching line of each hit chunk, ranked order, with `score` only in
`--json`). Exit code 0 if hits, 1 if none — same contract as grep.

`semgrep-core` is a library crate; the CLI is a thin wrapper, so the-library and
other Flower Computer apps can embed the engine directly.

## Benchmarks (speed, memory, CPU)

**Competitors:** BSD grep (`/usr/bin/grep`), GNU grep (`ggrep`), `rg`,
`ugrep`, `ack`. All invoked by absolute path (the dev shell wraps `grep`).

**Corpora:**
1. **Linux kernel** source tree (~1.4 GB, ~80k files) — the canonical grep
   benchmark corpus; results comparable to published rg/ugrep numbers.
2. **VS Code** repo (large TS/JS) — closest to real agent coding targets.
3. **Wikipedia subset** (~1–2 GB plain text extracted from a simplewiki dump)
   — prose/document search.

**Scenarios (per corpus):**
- Keyword: literal word; common word (many hits); rare regex; case-insensitive
  literal — semgrep-keyword vs all five competitors, cold FS cache noted, warm
  measured (hyperfine handles warmup).
- BM25/semantic/hybrid: semgrep only (competitors can't), measured in both
  *unindexed* (cold, includes the corpus pass/embedding) and *indexed* modes;
  plus `semgrep index` build time and on-disk index size.

**Metrics captured per run:**
- Wall time: `hyperfine` (median ± σ, ≥10 runs after warmup).
- Peak RSS + user/sys CPU: `/usr/bin/time -l` (macOS) parsed to JSON; CPU
  utilization = (user+sys)/wall shows parallelism efficiency.
- Index cost: build wall time, peak RSS during build, `.semgrep/` bytes on disk.

Output: `bench/results/*.json` + a generated markdown summary table. All
scripts live in `bench/` and are re-runnable end to end (`fetch-corpora.sh`
then `run.sh`).

**Measured after the v2 tuning round** (kernel corpus, warm): bm25 80 ms,
semantic 80 ms, hybrid 135 ms end-to-end; peak RSS 70 MB (bm25) / ~840 MB
(semantic, quantized matrix resident). Per-stage timings via `--stats`
("performance provenance": load:meta/chunks/bm25/mmap/hnsw,
rank:bm25/embed-query/brute|ann/fuse, finalize).

**Hypotheses verified in v1 benchmarks:**
- semgrep-keyword ≈ rg (same engine crates), far ahead of grep/ack.
- Unindexed BM25/semantic pay a full corpus pass — the question is whether
  ese keeps that in the "seconds, not minutes" range on 1.4 GB.
- Indexed semantic queries are ~ms but pay RSS for the loaded index; mmap of
  `emb.bin` + lazy HNSW load keep resident cost proportional to what's touched.

## Quality evals

**1. LLM-generated retrieval evals** (primary): sample chunks from each
corpus; have Claude write, per chunk, (a) a natural-language "where is the
code/passage that…" query and (b) a paraphrase query avoiding the chunk's
identifiers/keywords. Ground truth = source chunk (file + line span, with a
tolerance window). ~200 queries per corpus, spot-checked by hand. Score
recall@1/5/10, MRR@10, per mode × per tool (grep-family tools get a
best-effort keyword extraction from the NL query, which is exactly how agents
use them today — that gap is the headline metric).

**2. Agent-task evals** (secondary): ~20 tasks per corpus of the form "find
where X is handled"; run an agent (claude CLI headless) with only one search
tool available per condition; measure success rate, tool calls to success, and
tokens consumed. This measures the actual product goal: fewer, better search
round-trips for agents.

Harness in `eval/`: `generate.py` (query gen via claude CLI), `run.py`
(executes queries against each tool/mode), `score.py` (recall/MRR tables).

## Milestones

- **M1** — core engine + CLI + tests (this repo builds, fixture-corpus
  integration tests pass).
- **M2** — bench harness runs on all three corpora; first speed/RSS/CPU
  tables.
- **M3** — retrieval evals generated + scored; quality tables.
- **M4** — agent-task evals; tune (chunking, fusion, EF) on findings.
- **v2** — fold-based incremental/watch indexing; MCP server mode.
