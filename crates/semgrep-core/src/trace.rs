//! Per-stage timing provenance.
//!
//! `--stats` prints these, and the point of them is that "the query took 115 ms"
//! is unactionable while "load:bm25=84ms rank:brute=12ms" says what to fix. Every
//! measured number in RESEARCH.md that led to a change came from reading one of
//! these lines.
//!
//! Three properties make that trustworthy, and none of them came free:
//!
//! **The set of stages is closed.** [`Stage`] is an enum, not a string, so a
//! stage cannot be invented at a call site or spelled two ways at two call
//! sites. It was `Vec<(String, f64)>` built ad hoc at fourteen sites, which is
//! how "no test can assert the indexed path always reports these stages"
//! (AUDIT.md) became true.
//!
//! **The shape is fixed.** A path declares a [`SCHEDULE_WARM`]-style schedule up
//! front and [`Trace::finish`] emits *every* stage on it, zero-filled if it never
//! ran. So `rank:ann` and `rank:brute` both appear with one of them zero, and
//! `repair:walk` appears whether or not repair fired. A consumer keying on stage
//! names sees the same keys every time, which is what lets a simulation compare
//! two runs without special-casing which optional stages happened to fire.
//! Zero-filling is not new — `LoadTimings` has always emitted its five
//! components unconditionally; this generalizes it.
//!
//! **Every stage is a leaf in exactly one [`Bucket`].** That is what makes the
//! summary fields derivable rather than separately measured, and it is the whole
//! reason the residual means anything: if `rank_ms` is its own `Instant` *and*
//! the `rank:*` stages are summed, the two disagree for legitimate reasons
//! (nesting) and `total - accounted` is noise. Derived, they reconcile by
//! construction, and the one number left over — `total_ms - accounted_ms` — is
//! exactly the work nobody is timing. A test gates it, so the next untimed step
//! fails the build instead of quietly widening the gap.
