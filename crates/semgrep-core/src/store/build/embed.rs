//! Writing `emb.bin`: embed in batches, unit-normalize, quantize to i8.
//!
//! Batching is what keeps the build's memory flat. Chunk texts are owned copies,
//! but only one batch is resident at a time, so a corpus of any size costs the
//! same working set. `ese` also parallelizes internally above 16 texts, so
//! batches are the unit of that too.
