//! The on-disk index: reading and writing a `.semgrep/` directory.
//!
//! ```text
//! meta.json   version, chunk params, dims, file table (staleness)
//! chunks.bin  postcard Vec<Chunk>
//! bm25.flat   flat mmap-able BM25 (term table + postings + doc lens)
//! emb.bin     n_chunks × EMBED_DIM i8, unit-normalized then quantized
//! hnsw.bin    optional anny HNSW graph
//! sif.bin     optional corpus token statistics (SIF-weighted indexes)
//! graph.bin   optional file graph — import edges (RESEARCH.md §35.3)
//! ```
//!
//! This layer persists and loads representations. Deciding *which* index answers
//! a query, and keeping it honest against a moving tree, is `cache`'s job.
//!
//! `meta.json` is written last and removed before a rebuild: writing it is what
//! publishes an index, so a reader either sees a complete one or none.
