//! The index as a cache (RESEARCH.md §8).
//!
//! A query path resolves to an index by: (1) `.semgrep/` at the path itself,
//! (2) `.semgrep/` at an ancestor, walking up the way git finds `.git` and
//! stopping at the repo boundary, `$HOME`, or the filesystem root, then (3) the
//! deepest central-cache entry whose root contains the path.
//!
//! Entries live under `$SEMGREP_CACHE_DIR` (default `~/.cache/semgrep`), keyed
//! by canonical corpus root, and are written as a side effect of cold ranked
//! searches. A cache entry is disposable: any failure to read one is a miss.
//!
//! Split by concern — resolution (here), compatibility generations (`gen`),
//! space reclamation (`budget`), and the read-repair overlay that keeps a warm
//! answer true of the current tree (`repair`).
